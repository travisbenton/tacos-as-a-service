# Tacos As A Service

## Huh?
This is a taco API that returns what specials local Austin taco shops are currently running.

## Endpoint
App is running at `http://tacos-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/`.

## Restaurants
Currently I am only supporting Torchys and Tacodeli, which can be found at `/torchys` and `/tacodeli` respectively.
